## deadlyforcedb/data-recipes

*A small repo of notes and scripts for collecting data on U.S. deadly force police incidents*

For the Stanford Journalism fall course, [Public Affairs Data Journalism](http://padjo.org), I'm thinking of doing a class project tracking officer-involved fatal incidents based on already-collected data that, at the very least, can have an additional layer of verification, and most likely, be augmented with more information. This repo contains notes and random scripts about existing projects. Other repos in [github.com/deadlyforcedb](https://github.com/deadlyforcedb) will contain front-end application code, data schemas, etc. for the class.
