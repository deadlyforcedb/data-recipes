Michael Leal, 30, while pinned face down to the floor by officer Carle Upshaw’s foot on his back. Allen, high on drugs, had smashed through the patio door of a Bellaire home, whose owner called police. Police say Allen disobeyed them, had reached for something in his pocket and was attempting to roll over, causing Leal to “fear for his own life.” But marks on Allen’s hands indicate he had been handcuffed. Two grand jury members said they felt pressured to not indict by a politically connected fellow juror. Both officers were no-billed.

Not only did these cops get away with murder, but the shooter, Officer Leal, has since been promoted within his department. He now supervises everyone who investigated him. The Bellaire Police Dept. basically congratulated him for killing an unarmed teenager. ",http://www.leagle.com/decision/199897227FSupp2d945_1876,Michael Leal,,,,,,,,,

An autopsy report would later show that he was drunk and had traces of marijuana in his system. He was driving home to his off-campus apartment from a bar when Carter said he noticed Redus weaving between lanes and decided to follow him, although he did not know the driver was a UIW student.

University officials have repeatedly claimed Carter had the right as a sworn police office to interrupt his late night food run to a nearby Whataburger and pursue Redus, even though he was off campus and did not know the driver was a UIW student. Carter has been on paid leave since the incident, and in its response to the civil lawsuit UIW officials defended his shooting of Redus as justified.

There are inconsistencies in Carter’s version of events from the point he began to follow Redus north on Broadway through Alamo Heights, but what is not in dispute is that Carter attempted to arrest Redus outside his apartment as he exited his vehicle and a scuffle ensued. Carter said Redus resisted arrest and fought with him before Carter finally fired six shots at close range, striking Redus five times.",http://www.therivardreport.com/uiw-semester-starts-with-protest-cameron-redus-shooting/,Christopher Carter,,,,,,,,,

The incident occurred just after 3:45 p.m. near the intersection of East Harbor Boulevard and Figueroa Boulevard (map), where an officer was struck by a GMC Sonoma pickup truck, a spokesman for the Ventura Police Department said.

The driver of the truck was stopped by traffic officers, and as they were talking to him, he allegedly put the vehicle in reverse gear and smashed into a truck behind him, Wilson said.

“He put the truck back in drive, drove forward, striking one of our officers,” Wilson said. “That officer landed up on the hood of the [Sonoma] and into the windshield.”

8/20/2014 13:57:01,5/22/2013,CA - California,San Diego,Vista,San Diego Sheriff's Office,Anthony Garcia,19,Male,White,Hispanic or Latino origin,1,Hit,Unarmed,Unarmed,"Full disclosure:  I am an attorney for the victim.  The information below is from the police reports and witness statements.  I'd be happy to email the police reports, investigations and witness statements if Deadspin would like to review the evidence itself.

Police were called because a neighbor believed 4 teenagers were smoking pot in an apartment complex's laundry room.  The sheriff's office responded to the call because it was in the unincorporated part of Vista, California.  A 25 year old female, alone, approached the four people.  There was no signs of pot.  Nevertheless, Deputy Storms decided to do a warrant check.  She handcuffed one of the individuals and sat him down on the curb outside the laundry room.  She went to handcuff the victim, who asked why he was being arrested.  She told him to shut up or she would tase him.  He then looked over his shoulder at her and she told him to turn around or she was going to tase him.  She then bear hugged him.  The victim (5'7"" 190lbs  (arrest records indicate 5'8"" 220lbs, of course)), then tried to get away believing he was about to be tased.  He pushed the officer out of the laundry room.  She still had him in the bear hug position as if she was about to suplex him.  The two fell to the ground, Deputy Storms falling on her back.  Witnesses state that the victim never once tried to strike Deputy Storms and was struggling to try to get away.  Deputy Storms discharged her taser during the fracas on the ground and the probes missed the victim but nearly hit the bystanders.  The victim got to his feet and began to run.  While he was at least 30 feet away, Deputy Storms shot him in the back.  The bullet entered about 4"" to the right of the spine, severed the victim's lung, liver and spleen and ultimately came to rest immediately behind his right nipple.  The victim spent weeks in the hospital recovering.

The following day, Deputy Storms said that she looked up from the sidewalk and saw the victim with her taser and believed he was about to shoot her.  The taser was on the ground about 40 feet from the victim at the time he was shot IN THE BACK, something that the journalists and officers doing the investigation fail to address in their coverage.

Misdemeanor warrants for possession of marijuana and no valid driver's license had been issued for Eye by Dallas County. Eye also was suspected of stealing a 2000 Kia on November 11, 2011.

Eye refused to stop for the officer and a pursuit ensued, which went from Texas County into Dent County on Missouri Route 32. During that pursuit, Eye caused his vehicle to strike the front of the trooper's cruiser, disabling the patrol vehicle. Eye continued and was not located that night.

At approximately noon, November 20, 2011, information was developed indicating that Eye was possibly on or near a county road, north of Interstate 44, in western Pulaski County.

Approximately 30 minutes later, troopers located a stolen Chevrolet pickup, occupied by a white male, which they believed to be Eye, backed into a wooded area off Randolph Road, approximately one mile west of Missouri Route 7.

When troopers ordered the suspect to show his hands he refused to comply. He then accelerated and steered his vehicle toward the officers. In response, the troopers fired at the suspect with their Patrol issued rifles. The suspect then drove west on Randolph Road, while being pursued by officers, until the vehicle traveled off the left side of the road and stopped.

At that time, the trooper observed the suspect moving around in his vehicle and brandishing a firearm. The trooper responded by firing his Patrol-issued rifle at the suspect.",http://www.komu.com/news/officer-involved-shooting-in-pulaski-county/,,,,,,,,,,

The fight with Mylo wound up on the ground. The teen initially was on his stomach but managed to roll onto his back. One officer entwined Mylo's legs with his own, a wrestling move known as a reverse grapevine.

The officer grabbed the back of Mylo's head. He pulled down hard, forcing Mylo's chin tight against the teen's own chest. That made it difficult for Mylo to open his mouth and reduced the officers' risk of being bitten by him. They remained in that position while the other officers tried to pin Mylo's arms.

The teen still was talking. Then, officers reported, he suddenly slipped into unconsciousness. Handcuffs were snapped around his wrists. Officers bound his feet with nylon straps. When his family read the reports later, it bothered them that one of the restraints used was the leash a police dog handler had been carrying in her uniform pocket.

Mylo was placed on a paramedic's backboard and strapped down. The officers told the aid crew waiting nearby that Mylo, though unconscious, had a pulse and was still breathing.

The paramedics moved in and quickly realized that wasn't so. They got Mylo's heart pumping and restored his breathing.

An ambulance raced him to the hospital, where doctors determined his brain had died. There was nothing doctors could do. Four days later, Mylo took his last breath.",http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20080814/NEWS010309/708681372,N/A,,,,,,,,,

8/20/2014 20:55:44,12/28/2011,MI - Michigan,,Dearborn,Dearborn Police Department,Hassan Ibrahim Bazzi,39,Male,Unknown,Not of Hispanic or Latino origin,5,Hit,Unarmed,car,"Police said that Bazzi was pulled over for failing to yield to a fire truck. He was also allegedly driving at high rates of speed and disregarding traffic control devices. Bazzi allegedly drove toward the Dearborn officer who pulled him over and attempted to strike him with his car according to police, which led to the officer firing five shots at Bazzi's car. 
Witnesses at the scene also confirmed they heard five shots that sounded like pistol fire. 
Bazzi was not hit by the shots and continued driving and crashed into another vehicle shortly afterward, ending up in front of the ACCESS sign where clothes and several other items were strewn all over the middle of Schaefer Road. 
After the crash, Bazzi attempted to flee and was captured by officers. Both Bazzi and the arresting officer suffered minor injuries according to Dearborn Police and were treated at a local hospital. According to Majed Moughni, a Dearborn-based attorney who has agreed to take on Bazzi's case pro bono, Bazzi was suffering from schizophrenia at the time and was not taking his medication, which may have caused him to have a fearful, irrational reaction.
Moughni also said that the shots were aimed at the backseat of Bazzi's car. The debris scattered all over the road was likely from his car, which he had been living out of according to Moughni. Bazzi had originally offered to pay Moughni with food stamps to defend him. 
Moughni also said that a witness told him that Bazzi was ""beaten up pretty well"" by police after he attempted to flee. 
No matter what happens in the meantime, the likely final outcome is that Bazzi, a Lebanese immigrant, is deported, said Moughni. With Bazzi’s previous felony conviction and a laundry list of new felonies pending against him, immigration authori-ties have issued a prisoner hold, meaning that even if he posts the $300,000 bond for this case, he will remain in custody to be dealt with by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Bazzi, 39, immigrated in 1991 and is a legal resident, Moughni said.

Asked what is his goal for his client in this case, Moughni said, “to have him deported as soon as possible so that taxpayers don’t have to pay unnecessary costs.”

A passing stranger helped them change the tire, but the spare was also flat, so the man led them to a filling station. But the tire would not inflate, and so Ms. Miller waited in the car while the man drove her friend home to get assistance from the family. When relatives arrived they found Ms. Miller apparently comatose in the locked car, with the engine running and the radio on. She was shaking bodily and foaming at the mouth, and had a .380 semi-automatic pistol in her lap.[2][3] Unable to wake her they called 9-1-1. Four Police officers arrived at the scene within minutes and, informed by family members of the presence of a gun in the car, approached the vehicle with guns drawn.[3] After attempting for several minutes to get a response from Miller, the decision was made to force entry into the vehicle as Miller was in apparent need of immediate medical attention.[3] As one of the officers was attempting to remove the gun, Miller is said to have sat up and grabbed the weapon at which point the officers opened fire 23 times, hitting Ms. Miller with at least 12 bullets, including four in the head. The officers involved, three white and one Hispanic, were placed on administrative leave. They claimed they had acted in self-defense.

The releasing of the coroner's report prompted protests from the community, who rallied at the police headquarters, demanding an independent investigation, amongst suggestions that institutional racism had played a role.The officers involved were fired from Riverside Police Department but did not face prosecution due to ""insufficient evidence.""

8/20/2014 23:39:28,12/6/2013,TX - Texas,Bexar,San Antonio,UIW-PD (University of Incarnate Word PD),Robert Cameron Redus,23,Male,White,Unknown,5,Hit,Unarmed,"DWI, Intoxicated, Belligerent","SAN ANTONIO — University of the Incarnate Word student Cameron Redus, a 23-year-old, was shot five times — including once in the back — during a fatal altercation with a campus police officer last year, according to an autopsy report released Thursday by the Bexar County Medical Examiner's office.

Authorities said the shooting came after a six-minute struggle in the parking lot of the Treehouse Apartments in Alamo Heights, where Redus lived.

A toxicology test also showed Redus had a blood alcohol content of .155, nearly twice the legal limit to drive, when authorities say he fought UIW officer Christopher Carter on Dec. 6 in the parking lot of Redus' off-campus apartment complex near Incarnate Word.

The Dec. 7 autopsy conducted by Dr. Elizabeth Peacock found that five bullets had struck Redus in the left eye, upper chest, left elbow, right hip and upper back. The report didn't say which wounds came first, but it concluded that the shot to the back was the “most immediately lethal.”

At a past press conference, Alamo Heights Police Chief Richard Pruitt said Carter was driving on Broadway in a marked UIW police pickup truck when he spotted another truck being driven erratically. It was in the early morning hours of Dec. 6, and Carter saw the truck strike a curb and swerve briefly into the oncoming lanes.

Carter followed the suspected drunken driver. He was outside his jurisdiction, but Carter was a licensed peace officer authorized to arrest DWI suspects anywhere in Texas.

The officer followed Redus and activated the emergency lights of his police truck near the Treehouse Apartments, where Redus parked and got out of his vehicle.

The dash cam of Carter's truck didn't record video of the altercation, but Carter was wearing a microphone that recorded audio. Pruitt said the recording captured Carter asking Redus to stop and put his hands on the truck. Redus complied, but began to struggle when Carter started to handcuff him, Pruitt said.

During the six-minute confrontation, Carter told Redus 14 times to put his hands behind his back and told him three times that he was under arrest, Pruitt said. Carter told Redus to stop resisting 56 times, Pruitt said.

Redus at one point grabbed Carter's police baton and struck the officer with it, authorities said.

Carter regained control of the baton and Redus broke free. Pruitt said Carter drew his handgun, ordered Redus to stop, and Redus charged him with his hand raised. Carter fired six times.

Fabian Garza, 21, was driving a 1994 Cadillac El Dorado that rear-ended a white SUV early Friday in the drive-through of Chacho's, in the 8600 block of Perrin Beitel Road on the Northeast Side.

Garza tried to back up and leave the scene of the 1 a.m. wreck, according to police. The SUV's driver, whose identity is unknown, “exchanged words” with the people in the Cadillac and left the scene, according to police.

A witness told Officer Robert Encina of the San Antonio Police Department about the incident and added . Encina was in full uniform working an off-duty security job at the restaurant, of the incident, adding that the people in the Cadillac seemed intoxicated.

The witness said the officer repeatedly asked Garza to turn off the car and step outside the car. Garza and his passenger Marquise Jones, 23, were not following Encina's orders and Jones seemed to be reaching for something in the car, the witness told police.

Encina was able to turn off the car himself, and put the keys on the roof while trying to handcuff Garza, according to police.

At that point, police said Jones got out of the passenger door and pulled a revolver from the area of his waist, turning to look at Encina.

The witness said Encina then fired shots.

Jones started to run westward before collapsing, according to the police report.

An arriving officer found Jones lying face down toward Perrin Beitel road with a gunshot wound on the left side of his back. He was not breathing and was pronounced dead within minutes, according to police.

Sheriff's officials stressed that it was ""a federal officer"" and not them who fired, so the case was turned over to the FBI.

Houston’s family told the deputies that Houston was living in the storage unit, was making irrational comments over the phone and on social networks, and was high on methamphetamine and armed. Deputies called Houston, and Houston said he would kill them and anyone else who tried to contact him.

The SWAT team was called in and a negotiator was able to talk Houston into coming out of the unit. Houston partially opened the garage door, but refused to cooperate with the SWAT team’s commands to put his hands on his head and turn around. SWAT members fired non-lethal projectiles at Houston in an attempt to subdue him, but the projectiles had no effect on Houston. He went back inside the unit and closed the door.

To prevent Houston from using his car that was parked in front of the door, SWAT members attempted to tow it away. As the team was hooking a cable to the vehicle, Houston began firing a gun through the garage door. One SWAT member was struck in the arm. Two other team members returned gunfire through the door with their rifles. The gunfire inside the storage unit stopped.

Team members attempted to contact Houston, but were unsuccessful. They entered the storage unit and found Houston deceased on the floor with a handgun and expended casings next to him.

According to Medical Examiner Dr. Thomas Clark, Houston died from a gunshot wound to his abdomen. Dr. Clark also determined Houston had methamphetamines, marijuana and oxycodone in his system at the time of his death.

She warned the police that he might run and said “Don’t shoot him, please don’t hurt my baby” to the dispatcher. Pike had active warrants and had evaded police before.

When police showed up, Pike got in his car and backed out of the driveway. Police contend that he hit an officer, and two officers drew guns and began firing to prevent him hitting another officer. Pike's family contend that this was unnecessary and an escalation of force. Police respond that they first used a taser, but to no effect. The officer Pike hit was treated and released from a hospital. The two officers involved in the shooting were placed on administrative leave with pay during an investigation.

This is the third shooting by GCPD within the month. Other recent GCPD shootings happened April 10th and 22nd

Notes on accuracy for other people to fix:
1. Total number of shots fired is unknown. The number 6 is a baseless assumption that each of the two officers fired 3 shots, and is just a placeholder due to this form only accepting numbers greater than zero for shots fired. 
2. It is listed as unknown if the victim was armed. This is fuzzy, since driving a car isn't considered 'armed,' but he allegedly used it as a weapon.",http://www.cbs46.com/story/22256456/911-call-in-gwinnett-county-officer-involved-shooting-released,,Yes,,,,,,,,

He told the 911 operator that he felt threatened by his neighbors, was armed and had barricaded himself inside, officials said.
Simpson said crisis negotiators spent hours trying to communicate with Scott, but they couldn't establish a meaningful dialogue. Neighbors said members of the SWAT team arrived after 10 p.m. and that gunfire erupted about 2:30 a.m., but police only would say that Scott shot at officers, who returned gunfire.

8/24/2014 19:36:02,6/16/2012,GA - Georgia,Clayton,Morrow,Clayton County Police,Marcus Bell,26,Male,Unknown,Unknown,,Killed,Unknown,Unknown,"Police initially were responding to domestic disturbance call at Sandlewood Apartments.  (The call was made by a neighbor of Marcus Bell.)  After the police spoke with Marcus Bell and his wife, Mr. Bell went back into his apartment and locked himself in.  Police issued warrants, claiming that his wife had injuries consistent with aggravated assault with a firearm.  (She disputes this and states they had only been arguing loudly.)  At some point in the long standoff with police, a SWAT team was called.  Once police secured warrants, they entered the apartment and shots were fired by police.  Marcus Bell was killed. (It isn't clear when he died from these injuries.  He was taken to hospital and officers refused to comment on his condition.) No officers were injured.  Georgia Bureau of Investigation was reportedly called in to investigate, but I could find no information on any prosecutions or police disciplinary action related to this case.

Investigators also identified sheriff’s Sgt. Manuel Diaz, a 20-year department veteran, as the lawman who shot and killed Craig Petersen, 52, a general contractor suspected of fatally stabbing a 71-year-old Borrego Springs resident.

Sheriff’s homicide unit Sgt. Roy Frank released new details on the case Thursday, saying Petersen went to the home of George Mendenhall, on Borrego Hills Road, about 6:30 or 6:45 a.m. Wednesday “regarding some tools.”

After Petersen left, a female member of Mendenhall’s family found Mendenhall in the garage, bleeding, about 7 a.m. He had been stabbed several times in the chest, and died a short time later, Frank said.

“The motive is still under investigation,” Frank said. “We are finalizing interviews to try to find out what the motive was.”

At least one witness provided deputies with information that Petersen was the suspect in the slaying. Deputies then launched a manhunt for him across the small desert community.

Petersen lived in a Borrego Springs trailer park and had known Mendenhall for about 10 years, Frank said.

About 1 p.m., Diaz was on patrol in the area of Japatul Valley and Descanso when he saw a light blue Ford F150 pickup in the Park and Ride lot at Interstate 8 and state Route 79. A man was in the cargo bed. Frank said that as Diaz approached, the man, subsequently identified as Petersen, grabbed a nail gun.

Frank said Diaz saw the man reach for something that looked like a weapon, and fired. Petersen fell in the truck bed.",http://www.sdcda.org/office/officer-involved-shootings.html,Sgt. Manuel Diaz,Yes,2,No thanks.,,,,,,

Allison Donnelly, 42, called the police after confronting an intruder — who was wearing a scarf over his face and holding some sort of weapon — on the first floor of the home she shares with three children and her mother, she said. The police said the intruder was Mr. Doerbecker.

Ms. Donnelly’s house is across the street from the Doerbeckers’. The intruder fled out the front door when she yelled, she said. Officers connected the investigative dots and soon went to the Doerbeckers’, where they tried but failed to have Kurt Doerbecker come out after speaking with him and his father, Lieutenant Smith said.

At that point, police officers took up positions around the house, Lieutenant Smith said. At least 20 officers initially responded, he said. Three of them were on the north side of the home when they saw a man exit through a ground-floor window. One officer was ultimately “forced to fire,” the police said.

An autopsy on Mr. Doerbecker conducted on Tuesday showed that a single bullet hit him in the head, according to a law enforcement official, though the precise entry point was not immediately clear.

Police responded at 6:46 a.m. to the report of a domestic disturbance on Musical Lane near the intersection of Firestone Drive and Westcliff Drive. That location is southwest of the Buffalo Drive and Summerlin Parkway interchange.

Metro Police Capt. Patrick Neville said a woman reported she was having an argument with her son and that he was out of control.

Police arrived and found a man with a butcher knife walking southbound on Firestone Drive. Neville said the man approached officers after authorities made several commands for him to stop.

The officers then discharged non-lethal rounds at the man, striking him four times, in an attempt to get him to stop, but the man continued toward officers with the knife, Neville said.

""Officers feared for their lives,"" he said.

The three officers then fired multiple shots at the man, who was pronounced dead at University Medical Center. Neville said he didn't know how close the officers were to the man when they opened fire.

Victor Chavez, the man's cousin, identified the man who was killed as Rafael Olivas.

Chavez, 21, described his cousin’s relationship with his mother as fairly typical, with arguments only once in a while.

“I still can’t believe it,” he said. “It hasn’t set in.”

Chavez said one of the last times he saw Olivas — known as “Ralfy” to relatives — was during a party for a younger family member. Olivas lived with his mother and has several siblings, he said.

Police said the mother wasn't injured during the argument with her son. It wasn’t immediately clear whether other family members were home at the time or what led to the argument.

“All I heard was he had a knife,” said Chavez, who rushed to join family at the scene after the shooting. “That’s no reason to be shot four times.”

The three officers involved were placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard procedure for officer-involved shootings. Their names will be released in 48 hours.

According to the reports, the police were called to the scene ""just before 9:30"" and another report from a first responder at 9:46 describes a man with multiple gunshot wounds. The investigation is ongoing with ""no timetable"" for completion.  The man may have attacked the officers once they entered the house making the death justifiable, but in my mind, it seems the police were a bit to willing to go into the home and confront the armed man (all purely speculative on my part).  It has been reported that he lived alone and I couldn't find any mention of the police finding anyone else in the home.  No hostage, which seems to lend to the general thought that the police had no reason to enter the home without trying a little harder to get the man to surrender peacefully.  My opinion, of course.

Inside the home, they saw Berger holding a handgun and retreated, Ramos said.

Deputies said Berger barricaded himself inside the Fair Oaks home Thursday afternoon after he was shot about 4 p.m. by a sheriff's deputy when he emerged from the home armed.

It was not initially clear whether the man had been hit. But a robot sent inside the home showed images of an unresponsive person, and SWAT team members later entered the home and found Berger's body, according to sheriff's Deputy Jason Ramos.

Ramos said Berger appears to have died as a result of the shot fired by a deputy, and not as the result of a self-inflicted wound.

One of the deputies, a 16-year-veteran, fired a single shot, wounding Berger who retreated into the house where he was found dead several hours later.

The suspect, Justin Beltran, was reportedly firing shots into the air, outside his home. Neighbors reported the incident to police. Investigators say, when they arrived, Beltran took off. Officers followed him to a house a few miles up the road, on the 3300 block of Hartlee Field. 
That's where two officers confronted Beltran.

""Once they started ordering him to exit the vehicle, he exited the vehicle holding a rifle,"" Ryan Grelle with Denton Police said. ""They gave him commands to drop the rifle. He never did and unfortunately we had to shoot him.""
Grelle says the suspect never fired the weapon, but did point it at the officers. That prompted one officer to open fire, striking Beltran in the head. Beltran was taken by CareFlight to Medical Center Plano, where he later died.
 
""He feared not for his safety, but for the other officer's safety that was on scene.

Santa Clara police are investigating the city's first shooting death of the year. A police officer fatally shot a man during a DUI stop on the 2400 block of Karen Drive Saturday night.

The neighborhood is trying to piece together exactly what happened Saturday night. Oscar Perez says he heard something as he was watching TV.

""I've heard gun shots before, but it was kind of faint, but I did hear one or two shots,"" he said.

Another neighbor said he clearly heard a police officer shout three warnings before shooting.

""And then the third one was, 'I told you to put your hands on your head, or I'm going to shoot you,'"" the neighbor said. ""And not even two seconds after he said that, two bullets rang out.""

He says it happened in a driveway. The shooting scene was cleaned up after investigators spent the night collecting evidence.

Police say the man who was shot was stopped by an officer for suspicion of driving under the influence.

""The driver was uncooperative with the officer, which prompted the officer to call for backup,"" Santa Clara Police Lt. Kurt Clarke said. ""The driver inside the vehicle reached for a weapon, that being a revolver, prompting the officer to respond.""

Police say the man died at the scene before medical teams could arrive.

Neighbors say the man who was shot is 42-year-old Jose Jesus Nunez and he lives in an apartment with two friends.

The neighbor who heard most of the incident says he was surprised at how quickly the officer pulled the trigger after the third warning.

""The thing that concerned me, and I didn't see what transpired, but right after he yelled that third warning, it wasn't even a second,"" he said.

Nunez's family says they are still trying to get information about what happened.

The officer involved in the shooting has been placed on paid administrative leave, standard during an officer involved shooting. ",http://abc7news.com/archive/8506259/,na,Yes,3,No thanks.,,,,1/15/2012,1,"No, I have an incident/more incidents to log."
4/27/2015 15:20:38,1/15/2012,FL - Florida,na,Jacksonville,Jacksonville PD,na,17,Male,Unknown,Unknown,2,Killed,Armed,Toy/fake/non-lethal gun,"A 17-year-old boy was killed by Jacksonville police officers early Saturday after police said he used a fake gun to hold up a Westside convenience store.

It was the fourth police-involved shooting on the First Coast since the start of the year, and the second that ended in a fatality.

Two officers were conducting a stakeout at the Kangaroo convenience store on Old Middleburg Road at Fouraker Road about 2:50 a.m. when they saw the teen identified as Craig Ruise enter a side door. The store is one of two Westside stores that have been held up nine times since Nov. 12, according to Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office Chief Tom Hackney.

The two officers watched through the store window as the teen pointed a gun at two clerks in the store, Hackney said, and the clerk gave him cash as the fake gun — later determined to be spray-painted black — was pointed at them.

The teen then ran out of the front door of the store where he was confronted by the two police officers. Hackney said the officers drew their weapons and ordered the teen to halt and surrender.

“That subject failed to comply. He was still armed with the gun in his hand as well as the money from the robbery,” Hackney said. “After refusing the orders to comply, the officers fired at the suspect. The suspect was hit. Jacksonville Fire and Rescue was called and they announced the suspect was dead at the scene.”

Hackney said the officers fired a combined volley of seven to eight bullets at Ruise with most hitting him in the torso. Ruise was still holding the fake gun when he hit the ground. Two slugs from the guns fired by the police hit a nearby plastic fence, Hackney said.

Officer Mark E. Campanaro is a 10-year veteran of the department, while William H. Irvin has been with the department for five years. Hackney said both are on administrative leave, as is Sheriff’s Office procedure following any police-involved shooting.

Hackney said Ruise was holding a replica of a Colt 1911. He said there was no way of telling that the gun was a fake as officers confronted him.

“It was a clear plastic gun that had been painted black,” Hackney said at a news conference Saturday afternoon. “It did have a red plastic tip that was partially visible. But this is a very distinct-looking gun and with a little black spray paint, it looked like the real thing.”

Hackney said police believe that Ruise is responsible for the string of holdups over the past two months. But he acknowledged “we’re still looking into that.”

Hackney said each of the holdups over the past two months involved a black handgun and an African-American male of short stature. The robber was wearing a mask over his face.

The armed robberies occurred on Nov. 12, 25, 29 and Dec. 17 at the Kangaroo. There were robberies at another convenience store on Normandy Boulevard near Blair Road on Nov. 20, Dec. 4, Jan. 2 and 9.",http://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/1051687-17-year-old-holding-fake-gun-during-robbery-shot-dead-by-jso/,"Mark E.
